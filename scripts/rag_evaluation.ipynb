Change directories to the location of the fork you cloned.\\n    - To go to your home directory, type just `cd` with no other text.\\n    - To list the files and folders in your current directory, type `ls`.\\n    - To go into one of your listed directories, type `cd your_listed_directory`.\\n    - To go up one directory, type `cd ..`.\\n1.
